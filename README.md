# osu-AutoBeatmapGenerator
Automated highly-customizable program for creating pattern-training difficulties from existing maps in osu!

Things to implement before public release:  
1) Remove existing breaks from the song, make the break time divide by the bpm!  
2) Implement horizontal and vertical (parallel jumps) and maybe other kinds of 1-2 jumps  
3) Remake the architecture to handle lazy pattern addition in the end (+ make deletion of the patterns possible + make breaks appear in the pattern list too)  
4) Change the timing point on approaching
